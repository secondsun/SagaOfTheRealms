#Saga of the Realms

This is the beginning of a space shooter game that I wrote a lot of plot for in high school and undergrad.  Currently it targets Android TV devices with Gamepads running Marshmallow.  Eventually I will port it to Raspberry Pi assembly and then to a J2 FPGA with custom FPGA sprite hardware.
